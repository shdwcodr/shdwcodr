### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I’m a cybersecurity-focused dev working in silence toward **Google Summer of Code 2026**, contributing to core open-source projects like the **Tor Daemon**, and preparing for kernel-level work.  
No noise — just code, commits, and long-term leverage.

---

### 🛠️ Current Focus

- 🔐 **Low-level systems dev** (C, C++)
- 🧠 **Tor Project contributor** – daemon-level contributions
- 🛠️ **ONiST** – an OSINT tool that digs deep, correlates public data for threat analysis
- 🧰 Building automation tools, solving CTFs, prepping for real-world red team ops
